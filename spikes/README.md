# Lifely UI Spikes

Quick standalone HTML demos to pick component variants before wiring the generator.

Files:
- `hero.html` — Boarding-pass hero with count-up stats (dots progress).
- `people.html` — Vertical stack of sparkbar people cards with venue/hood chips.
- `places.html` — Default stacked bars + optional map heat placeholder.
- `rituals.html` — Horizontal bars for activities.
- `rituals-tiles.html` — Tile-style rituals variant.
- `patterns.html` — Insight list with icons.
- `narrative.html` — Typewriter narrative card (respects reduced motion).
- `experiments.html` — Numbered CTA list.
- `experiments-grid.html` — Grid-style experiments variant.
- `data-preview.html` — Pulls real data from `/data/stats_2025.json` into the default layout (bars for places/rituals).
- `hero-minimal.html` — Minimal center-stack hero variant.

Shared styles/JS:
- `base.css` — Tokens, cards, bars, chips, map styling.
- `base.js` — Count-up, bar animation, typewriter, progress helper.
